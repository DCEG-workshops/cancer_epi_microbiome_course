Dr. Vogtmann investigates connections between the human microbiome and cancer risk using cutting-edge microbial techniques in epidemiologic studies. Her work involves analyzing oral and fecal samples from large cohort studies to assess prospective associations with cancer development. She also develops and validates optimal methodologies for microbiome sample collection, storage, and analysis to support large-scale research and future meta-analyses.
